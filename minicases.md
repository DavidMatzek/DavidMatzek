# Case: Developing Intelligent Functions to goLive.

## Context: 
- BMW wanted to introduce intelligent funtions in car, that benefit customers with a wow-effect.
- Over 50 customers functions stared development.

## Challanges:
- Project started way behind development schedule.
- Multiple departments competed for budget in a political fashion.
- Various Stakeholders at a time (Savety of Use, Data Protection, User Expereience, Implementers, Testers, Plants, Quality Managers, ...)
- Learning fom customer behavior was a totally new field.
- E/E Architecture was not prepared.
- Tight budget

## My Role:
- I was a **Function Owner** with End to End technical responsability for two functions
- Focus shifted from E/E architecture -> functional design including UX -> implementation -> testing -> series support

## Key Decisions:
- Developing the committed functions without political involvement.
- Keepling close contact to all relevant technical stakeholders.
- Using Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) to describe and communicate functionality.

## Outcome:
- My two functions (Automated window Opening, Learning Seat Climateization) were released in 2019 starting with G20. 42 Other projects died along the way.
- Two patent specifications were released.
- Now the automated window opening has the best conversion rate and the highest use out of all intelligent functions in 2025 protfolio.
