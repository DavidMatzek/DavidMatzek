# Case: Developing Intelligent Functions to goLive.

## Context: 
- BMW wanted to introduce intelligent funtions in car, that benefit customers with a wow-effect.
- Over 50 customers functions stared development.

## Challenges:
- Project started way behind development schedule.
- Multiple departments competed for budget in a political fashion.
- Various Stakeholders at a time (Savety of Use, Data Protection, User Expereience, Implementers, Testers, Plants, Quality Managers, ...)
- Learning fom customer behavior was a totally new field.
- E/E Architecture was not prepared.
- Tight budget

## My Role:
- I was a **Function Owner** with End to End technical responsability for two functions.
- Focus shifted from E/E architecture -> functional design including UX -> implementation -> testing -> series support.

## Key Decisions:
- Developing the committed functions without political involvement.
- Keepling close contact to all relevant technical stakeholders.
- Using Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) to describe and communicate functionality.

## Outcome:
- My two functions (Automated window Opening, Learning Seat Climateization) were released in 2019 starting with G20. 42 Other projects died along the way.
- Two patent specifications were released.
- Now the automated window opening has the best conversion rate and the highest use out of all intelligent functions in 2025 protfolio.

# Case: Conzepualise Data Middleware to provide standardized data.

## Context: 
- In order to facilitate development and data analytics standarized vehilce data was needed accross automotive indutriy.
- To prepare integration of AI, the same data format should exist in car and in backend systems. 

## Challenges:
- Project Stakholders from different departments had an intense conflict. The predecessor left the project.
- Highly complex sourrounding systems, affected by constant changes, sometimes released without documentation.
- Target was not accepted, there was no implementer named. 

## My Role:
- Centeral **Vehicle Data Architect**: Responsible to design a solution for which some department takes over responsiblity for implementation.

## Key Decisions:
- Close collaboration and trust building among various stakeholders.
- Participation in COVESA All members Meeting, to present architectural concept and testing strategy to ged high qulity feedback from specialists across automotive industiries.
- Offer Data Mddle Ware inside data collection framework, so all data collectors profit at one.
- Integrate Data Middleware in MBSE and interconnect ist with board net data base and [Vehicle Signal Specification](https://github.com/COVESA/vehicle_signal_specification).
- Offer a code generator which produces data middle ware tailored to any derivative with its unique board net version.
- Highly automate testing producing a landingpage with transparent test results.

## Outcome:
- Data Middelware is integrated in Neue Klasse E/E Architecture, starting with iX.
- Patent Specification (currently in review).

# Case: Leading a tree based standardization language into an onthology.

## Context:
Large-scale system landscape with heterogeneous data sources 
and multiple consumer domains.

## Challenge:
High integration effort, inconsistent semantics, limited scalability.

## My Role:
Lead architect responsible for data modeling and governance principles.

## Key Decisions:
• Introduced canonical data models
• Defined lifecycle and ownership principles
• Aligned business and technical stakeholders

## Outcome:
• Reduced integration complexity
• Improved cross-domain data usability
• Enabled scalable future extensions
