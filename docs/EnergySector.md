# Relocation & Salary – Personal Positioning Summary

This section summarizes my **thoughts, constraints, and expectations** regarding relocation to Switzerland and compensation, intended to ensure **long-term sustainability and mutual clarity**.

---

<details>

## 1. Current Baseline (Germany)

- Current gross salary: **~100,000 €**
- Location: **Nördlingen (low cost of living)**
- Very favorable conditions regarding:
  - housing
  - childcare / kindergarten
  - overall family expenses

This baseline is important, as relocation must **at least maintain** a comparable quality of life.

---

## 2. Relocation Perspective

- Relocation to Switzerland is a **significant family decision**
- Family situation:
  - married
  - two young children
  - spouse currently working **~30 hours/week**
- A stable family setup is a **prerequisite for long-term performance and commitment**

Relocation is only realistic if:
- financial pressure is manageable
- childcare and housing can be organized reliably
- the overall framework supports a sustainable daily life

---

## 3. Cost of Living Considerations (Switzerland – Aargau)

Key differences compared to Germany:
- **Housing costs:** ~2× higher for family-appropriate housing
- **Childcare:** significantly higher, especially for Kita
- **Healthcare:** mandatory private insurance for each family member
- **Taxes:** lower than Germany, but offset by insurance and childcare costs

These factors strongly influence disposable income.

---

## 4. Salary Expectation – Equivalent & Attractive Range

To make relocation:
- financially neutral **and**
- professionally attractive

the following considerations apply:

- Cost-of-living adjustment vs. current situation
- **10–20% career-change premium**
- Seniority, responsibility, and strategic impact of the role

### Resulting target range:
- **CHF 160,000 – 175,000 gross per year**

Below this range:
- risk of lifestyle downgrade
- increased family-related pressure

Within this range:
- sustainable family life
- mental space to focus on performance and impact
- realistic long-term relocation perspective

---

## 5. Framing in Conversations

Key principle:
> **This is not about maximizing compensation, but about ensuring sustainability and long-term commitment.**

Suggested wording:
> “Considering my current situation, the cost of living in Switzerland, and the responsibility of the role, I would see a total compensation in the range of CHF 160,000 to 175,000 as a realistic and sustainable basis for relocation.”

---

## 6. Long-Term Perspective

- Switzerland offers:
  - long-term stability
  - strong engineering and infrastructure focus
  - potential pathway to permanent residence and citizenship
- These long-term benefits only make sense if the **initial framework is viable**

---

## Guiding Principle

> **Sustainable conditions enable long-term impact.**  
> A stable family and financial setup is the foundation for professional excellence.
