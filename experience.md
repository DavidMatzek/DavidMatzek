## Lead Data Designer  
**BMW Group** — Global Enterprise Environment  
*01/2023 – Present*

### Context
Large-scale transformation towards software-defined systems with increasing
demands on data consistency, scalability, and cross-domain interoperability.

### Responsibilities
- Architectural ownership of **domain-wide data concepts and data models**
- Definition of **data design principles** across multiple platforms and
  digital touchpoints
- Establishment of semantic consistency through **ontology-based modeling**
- Design of data abstraction layers to decouple consumers from producers
- Architectural alignment between business, product, and engineering units
- Governance of data lifecycle, interfaces, and model evolution
- Coordination of multiple parallel initiatives under a unified architecture

### Key Contributions & Impact
- Designed a **standardized domain data architecture** used across multiple
  systems and organizational units
- Introduced semantic modeling to ensure long-term data consistency and reuse
- Enabled scalable integration of new use cases without structural redesign
- Improved collaboration efficiency between teams through clear data contracts
- Ensured architectural coherence across independently developed solutions

**BMW Group** — Data Strategy & Platform Architecture  
*11/2021 – 12/2022*

### Context
Growing complexity of connected systems required a unified approach to data
integration, standardization, and lifecycle management.

### Responsibilities
- Architecture of **data integration and middleware layers**
- Standardization of domain data across heterogeneous systems
- Definition of data flows from data generation to consumption
- Alignment of technical architecture with strategic data goals
- Collaboration with platform, security, and governance stakeholders

### Key Contributions & Impact
