# Hi, I’m David 👋

I am a **Lead Data Designer & Systems Engineer** with a strong background in
**data architecture, system standardization, and large-scale digital platforms**.

My work focuses on designing **robust, future-proof data models** and
**architectural principles** for complex, distributed systems, bridging
business needs and technical implementation.
